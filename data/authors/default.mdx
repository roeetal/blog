Hi, I'm Ro-ee, welcome to my blog!

I am currently an applied scientist at AWS based in NYC, where I focus on creating language models that perform
robustly for business applications.
Before joining Amazon, I studied engineering physics at the University of British Columbia.
There, I built robots, simulated physical systems, worked in a quantum devices lab, designed software, and did some computer vision
research for health-care and the forestry industry.
Towards the end of my studies, I spent a semester at ETH Zurich where I focused on deep learning.
I was born and raised in Johannesburg, South Africa, and, from what I can remember, spent all my
time there in the sun before moving to Canada.

I decided to create this blog for a couple of reasons, the main one being to share some of my
thoughts, ideas, or projects with people who may find what I have to say interesting or would be willing to
provide some constructive feedback.
But I also hope this blog will serve as a platform to inspire personal growth.
I want to get better at writing more clearly, more effectively, more efficiently... and to become
comfortable expressing myself imperfectly.
After all, learning is a continuous and holistic journey; and doing it quickly requires this sort of
temporal vulnerability.
And maybe, over time, it will paint an interesting picture of my journey.
