It was COVID. People were distant, socially. Awkwardness and cough-shaming was on the rise; mental health
declining. Supply chains shattered.

In Vancouver, not much was going on but public spaces were open[^1] and beautiful in the summer.
I got my stimulus cheque... it was the perfect time to get back into cycling.
There was only one problem: no bikes!!!

So I wrote a [bot](https://github.com/roeetal/craigslist-bot) that scraped Craigslist every 2 minutes for postings matching my criteria and notified me each time
something new and relevant became available.

I was napping one sunday when I got the push notification.
Within minutes I was in an [EVO](https://evo.ca/) on my way to check out a 2014 Trek Madone with new mechanical Ultegra components.
Satisfied, I sent the payment through, and we waited...
Email after email came in with each refresh: "Is this still available?".
I had a cheeky grin on my face, knowing I locked in a solid deal.
Finally the payment went through and the seller commended me on my hustle and decisiveness
and wished me the best of luck.

I named the bike Tessa, and she was the most responsive, quick, smooth bike I had owned so far.
But the luck I was wished was in vain: after only a year of riding Tessa up the local mountains, what was
poised to becoming an eternal bond between man and bike ended abruptly.
I got t-boned by a Chevrolet Colorado and tore my MCL and PCL.

I should probably be dead right now instead of writing this post, so the fact that I'm not is arguably a big win.
And on the bright side my right leg is now stronger than it's ever been owing to a [great recovery](https://www.talltreehealth.ca/team/physio/van/nathan-hers).
In many ways, life can suck, either all at once or just constantly over a prolonged period of time in a depressing sort of way.
But thats why its vital to savor our little victoriesâ€”the simple, successful bot I wrote, the good rides[^2], and the great recovery I had.

[^1]: with certain social distancing rules in place.
[^2]: favorite being 3 mountains in one day: 135km, 2.7km elevation gain, max speed 84km/h.
