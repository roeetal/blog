I have only been around for about 27 years.
But I can say with some certainty that what makes humans *human* is our ability to form mental models
of our environment and our aptitude to develop skills that allow us to apply our mental models
to navigate the world. The study of knowledge (epistemology), how we gather it and how we develop
skills to apply it (intelligence?), are topics that interest me greatly but not the focus here,
so hopefully I'll get into it in another post. In this post, I want to discuss the distinction between
mental models and reality, and how we do (and should) navigate between the two realms.

I'll begin by borrowing an analogy from [The Great Ideas of Philosophy](https://www.audible.com/mk/t/title-3?asin=B00DDVSD34&source_code=GO1PP30DTRIAL54703142491H0&ds_rl=1261256&gad_source=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIw5PQ9r-TigMVMDMIBR1eXDN0EAAYASAAEgI6vfD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)
: [The Pythagorean Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem).
The theorem states *"the area of the square whose side is the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares on the other two sides"*.
Simple enough. And since this nifty blogging setup supports math display, I'll even include the
formula for the avid reader:
$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$

You might be wondering, other than 8th graders and maybe farmers, who cares about this theorem?
Well the point isn't the theorem itself, its more subtle and meta, its about theorems in general.
Imagine if this shitty blog suddenly crashed (which is quite likely given its running for free),
or better humanity *crashed*, or disappeared, the theorem would remain, in some abstract sense.

This is what I like to consider: **theory**. When you were in the 8th grade studying geometry,
and I hope you did, then you would sit at a desk holding a pencil (or maybe an iPad?), and think,
using your head, what does this triangle look like? You are forming a mental model of triangles,
and the lengths of their sides in proportion to each other.

But then, when you attempt to solve a problem and draw a triangle on a piece of paper and
measure the lengths and plug them in to the formula, you are doing practical work applying your
theory. Now, you can never really measure the sides of the triangle *exactly*, but you can get
close enough with extremely small uncertainty (possible error) if your parents were kind enough
to get you one of those nice, slick, accurate, metal rulers instead of those shitty plastic ones
with thick lines for increments.

We, as humans, do this stuff all the time, and it's kind of what separates us from other species.
At times we act on impulse, but at other times we think, we rationalize, using the mental models
we learned. A long time ago, in another life really, I came across an interesting read that explores
this in greater detail which you might like: [Thinking Fast and Slow](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555).

Unfortunately, the analogy we've been following is not entirely representative,
life is not always so simple and clear cut. Now, I'm not too sure about myself, but from what understand
talking to other people is the we (as humans) possess what are called *emotions*. I like
to think of them as biological intuition: they indicate some sort of automatic response immediately
without taking the time to explain themselves and leave it to us to try figure out the causal explanation
for the biological impulse we are feeling. The annoying part is that they can insert themselves,
rather inconveniently, into our thought processes and prevent us from utilizing our mental models properly.
Ideally, what you would expect from a rationally behaving person is that your lived experiences
are used to update your mental models, and your updated mental models help you live your life.
But what ends up happening is that first step is skipped.
Perhaps some of us are not good at handling our emotions.
As soon as we feel some impulse, we act so as to address to immediate and directly.
There is definitely merit to this a times. I cannot imagine sitting on a rollercoaster trying to
understand this dynamics of its acceleration and then use this newfound understanding to inform
they joy I should derive from it.
But, when it comes to making important decisions and reason over complex issues, I do think we
hinder ourselves when we respond this way.

Time and again I notice social media is particularly good at getting people to react emotionally,
rather than rationally. Social media presents you with some information. You distill that information
in some capacity (noting that process itself is probably imperfect) and it evokes in you some
emotional response. For me, I see someone with a very, very nice bike on a touring trip in the Italian
Dolomites and, immediately, I begin to doubt whether I am living the lifestyle that is best suited for me
(i.e. in NYC where cycling is not the best, working, not on a perennial biking tour that never seems to end using state of the art gear).
Should I quite my job and go on an endless biking adventure? Probably not. Should I go and get a
new bike? Probably not, the bike I currently have is quite nice and exceeds my needs.
Should I transition my career and be an influencer, thereby rationally justifying the seemingly desired outcome?
The risk profile for that decision is not to my taste, and I am not quite sure that would even be the best long-term decision for me.
Over the year I have developed some mental models, values, desires, which I use to decide on what work I find fulfilling,
how to manage my responsibilities. Perhaps, I can include in the list of wants a biking trip and see
how that experience goes.
