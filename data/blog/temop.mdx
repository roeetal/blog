moral objectivity: 

finance works by assessing risk, allocating capital while managing risk.
there is this duality.
do the same concepts apply to ethics.
is it moral to say on average people are better, even though, perhaps some people are suffering.
can a framework like effective altruism consider this?
SBF story.


physics -> quantum + optics
quantum -> reality, uncertainty, accepting the unknown
optics -> images, information loss, partial information

no moral objectivity because we do not have perfect information
there is only moral subjectivity

fundamentals required for people to get along, or not, but at least to understand why
1. realize everyone is subjective, each look through their own lens, only has access to partial information
2. embrace uncertainty, accept the fact the we do not have all the information
3. critically consider in which cases certain assumptions or viewpoints hold, makes sense,
are plausible, potentially valid, and where they cannot be so because there is insufficient evidence
when does something plausible hold until there is sufficient evidence?
when does something invalid not hold, even if there is not enough evidence against it?

job -> mediator between reality and the digital world
data -> how does it represent reality?
ML -> how can machines learn from the data to do something meaningful?
