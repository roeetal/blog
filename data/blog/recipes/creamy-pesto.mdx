As a South African, I am obligated to put avocado not just on my pizza but in pretty much every dish I can, pesto included.

| ingredient            |   quantity | unit   |
|-----------------------|------------|--------|
| basil                 |        3   | cups   |
| thyme                 |        3   | sprigs |
| pine nuts[^1]         |        100 | g      |
| grated parmesan[^2]   |        75  | g      |
| olive oil             |        200 | g      |
| avo                   |        0.25| avos   |
| garlic                |        1   | clove  |
| ice water             |        5   | tsp    |
| salt                  |            |        |

Instructions:

1. Normally my first instruction is to pour yourself a glass of wine. But, at the time of cooking, I had the flu, so no wine for me. But if you are healthy, go ahead and pour yourself a glass of wine.
2. Start boiling some water with plenty of salt added. Throw in basil and thyme stems once plucked.
3. Slice the garlic clove in half, smoosh it on the surface area of your food processor. I like a bit of garlic, so I even slice a few little thin disks with my food processor blade.
4. Add nuts and process finely.
5. Add basil, thyme leaves, avo, half the parmesan, olive oil.
6. Pulse a couple of times until leaves have been eaten up.
7. Turn the processor on and add ice water one teaspoon at a time.
8. Add the rest of the parmesan, process till incorporated.
9. Add salt to taste, process till incorporated.

[^1]: I ran out of pine nuts, so used also cashews and pistachios.
[^2]: Must be finely grated to blend well, otherwise sauce will appear separated, kind of like a chimmichuri.
