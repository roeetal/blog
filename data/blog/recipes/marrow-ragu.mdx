I draw inspiration for this recipe from
[Massimo Bottura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massimo_Bottura),
although I cut some corners to simplify things and, well, because I'm not trying to run the world's best
restaurant from my apartment on a wednesday evening.
Here are the ingredients. Feel free to try different meats to control the richness.

[^1]: White wine could work well too, maybe even better, but I didn't have.
