Note to self: if ever I am to have kids, make sure they read
*[The Lord of the Rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings)* before watching the movies.
Its not that I don't like the movies, I do... but I just imagine the books would be even more entertaining
not knowing what to expect from the storyline and not being biased by the imagery of the films.
